# Data Cleaning: Project Overview 
* Clean a database then use machine learning to predict the prices of the missing value
* Showcase data cleaning techniques like , drop rows, replace null values with unknown or 0s then we will predict the missing value with a model.
* 

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, 



## Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	drop the rows containing Null values 
*	drop the columns containing Null values 
*	Replace Null values with 'Unknown' or 0 
*	Replace missing values with predicted values
